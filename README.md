# BANKERS_ALGO
Implementation of Bankers algorithm using systems calls and multi_threaded .
Write a multithreaded program that implements the banker's algorithm. Create n threads
that request and release resources from the bank. The banker will grant the request only if it
leaves the system in a safe state. It is important that shared data be safe from concurrent
access. To ensure safe access to shared data, you can use mutex locks.
SIMPLE AND EFFICIENT.  :)
